                <h2>Gold-plated silver figure of Amun-Ra</h2>
                <p>Price: $110,000</p>
                <p>Seller: ShadowMaster23</p>
                <p>Description: This figure was cast in silver and decorated with gold overlays on the headdress, collar necklace, and kilt. His divine beard shows that he is a god, and his headdress identifies him as Amun. Though he was sometimes depicted as a ram, with short curling horns (or, in his Nubian temples, as a ram-headed god), Amun was primarily an anthropoid god. His crown, similar in shape to the red crown, is topped by two tall feathers and a sun disk.</p>
